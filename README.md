# simpleLisp

A boring Lisp implementation as an exercise.

## How to use
```
stack exec simpleLisp (add 1 (add 2 3))
````

## TODO
- Expression Evaluation (I'm not happy with the 24hour scheme implementation)
- Some sort of error handling for the evaluator
- Show Instance that recreates standard Lisp syntax
- QuickCheck tests based on parsing the show values of arbitrary Cons trees.
- A REPL
- Replace Term with a GADT and Existentials
